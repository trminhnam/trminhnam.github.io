<!-- I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at [The University of Science], Viet Nam National University Ho Chi Minh City, majoring in Computer Science. I am going to finish my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in August 2024 under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Dinh Dien and Dr. Nguyen Hong Buu Long and get a Bachelor's degree in October 2024. I am also a member of the [Computational Linguistics Center](https://www.clc.hcmus.edu.vn/) as a research assistant, where I work on projects related to natural language understanding of Vietnamse language models. -->

I'm a fourth-year Computer Science undergraduate student at [The University of Science, VNU-HCM](https://en.hcmus.edu.vn/), and expect to get my bachelor degree in November 2024. Supervised by [Professor Dien Dinh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5tqOcFMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Long HB Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jECXavQAAAAJ&hl=en), I completed my thesis with the topic "Exploring and Improving Language Understanding Abilities of Vietnamese Language Models." Besides that, as an undergraduate research assistant at the [Computational Linguistics Center](https://www.clc.hcmus.edu.vn/), I study Vietnamese language models for natural language understanding tasks.

My research directions focus on (but not limited to):
- **Large Language Model**: Natural language understanding, logical reasoning, hallucination of LLMs, their applications in real-world problems, etc.
- **Vision Language Model**: Multimodal reasoning and understanding.
- **Training/Learning Methods**: Learning strategies for improving the performance of LLMs and how to make them think like humans.


<!-- focuses on the application of large language models to traditional NLP tasks and real-world problems, as well as methods for improving their performance. I also collaborate on projects exploring the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, specifically in the domain of vision-language models. -->
